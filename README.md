# Erlang-RED Flow Testsuite

A collection of test flows to ensure node compatibility with original Node-RED nodes.

These flows are designed to be executed using the orignal [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) and the Erlang version - Erlang-RED.

They provide a definition of what functionality is expected from the existing core nodes of Node-RED.

These flows utilise [erlang-red-unittest](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red-unittesting-nodes) to ensure conformance.

## work in progress

The flows are currently part of the [Erlang-RED project](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/tree/main/priv/testflows) and will be moved over here soonish ... once there here, this comment will be removed!
