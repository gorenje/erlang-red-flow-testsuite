I will touch on those specifics. Remember Erlang-Red is mimicing how Node-RED works, which is advantageous (implicit learnings are onboarded) and disingenious (those features don't fit well to Erlang).\n\nThis will not describe the [services](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/82075b02258dfb31a566213c168c890c4564dafd/src/erlang_red_sup.erl) that are started by Erlang-Red.
